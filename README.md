# Nimble Wallet Generator

This script automates the setup process for a wallet using Nimble Technology's wallet-public repository.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/Raveen-AJ/nimble_wallet_gen.git)
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

3. Make the setup script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x wallet_gen.sh
    ```

4. Execute the script with your desired wallet name as an argument:

    ```bash
    ./wallet_gen.sh <WALLET_NAME>
    ```

    Replace `<WALLET_NAME>` with the name you want to assign to your wallet.

5. Follow any prompts or instructions provided during the installation process.
